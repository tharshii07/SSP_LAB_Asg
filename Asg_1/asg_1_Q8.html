      <div><p>IET, short for Institute of Engineering & Technology, kicked off its journey back on September 4, 1996, as a self-financing engineering institute under Devi Ahilya University, Indore. With a humble start of 90 students spread across Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering branches, IET-DAVV became a hotspot for budding engineers.
        Over time, IET expanded its horizons, gaining recognition from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, Government of Madhya Pradesh, and University Grants Commission (UGC). It became known for its dynamic curriculum, offering BE programs in six branches and even adding 180 more seats, making it 540 students per year.
        In 2002, IET stepped up to the PG level, offering ME programs in six specializations, and later introducing MSc in Applied Mathematics in 2006. It didn't stop thereâ€”PhD programs in various disciplines of BE/ME and other relevant areas soon followed.
        The institute has seen tremendous growth, with its lush green campus fostering a vibrant academic environment. Not to mention the stellar placements, with students landing gigs at top institutes and universities in India and abroad.
        IET's students have also left their mark in GATE examinations, bagging top ranks in 2001, 2002, and 2009. Plus, their prowess in Robotic Competitions and other tech-fests has garnered attention.
        The faculty isn't lagging behind either, with over 100 research publications annually at both national and international levels. They're even serving as editors and referees for prestigious journals.
        Cultural events at IET are nothing short of spectacular, often setting the bar high. The campus even caught the eye of MHRD, being chosen as the temporary location for IIT Indore.
        With MoUs signed with NIC, RRCAT, TCS, and Eicher Motors, IET is all about fostering knowledge exchange and pushing boundaries.</p></div>
